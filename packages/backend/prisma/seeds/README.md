# NdaFundPlatform Database Seed Scripts

This directory contains seed scripts to populate the NdaFundPlatform database with realistic test data.

## Overview

The seed scripts create a comprehensive dataset including:

- **25 diverse users** (5 test users + 20 random) across 4 types (activists, entrepreneurs, artists, donors)
- **10 fundraising campaigns** with various statuses and realistic goals
- **50-100 posts** with varied content (announcements, updates, questions, media)
- **100-200 comments** including nested replies
- **500-1,000 likes** on posts
- **50-100 reposts** (including quote reposts)
- **20-30 bookmarks**
- **50-80 follow relationships** creating a realistic social graph
- **Hashtags** extracted from post content
- **Campaign updates and milestones** for each fundraiser

## Seeding Modes

The system supports two modes for campaign seeding:

### 1. Offline Seeding (Default)
Creates campaign records with fake transaction hashes. Fast and doesn't require blockchain connection.

### 2. On-Chain Seeding
Creates actual fundraiser contracts on Base Sepolia blockchain, then stores the real blockchain data in the database.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. PostgreSQL database running
2. Database connection configured in `.env`
3. Dependencies installed: `npm install`

### Running the Seed

```bash
# Standard offline seeding
npm run seed

# Or using Prisma directly
npx prisma db seed
```

### On-Chain Campaign Seeding

```bash
# Option 1: Run on-chain seeding only
npm run seed:campaigns

# Option 2: Run full seed with on-chain campaigns
npm run seed -- --onchain

# Option 3: Set environment variable
SEED_ONCHAIN_CAMPAIGNS=true npm run seed
```

### Full Reset & Seed

```bash
# Reset database and run migrations
npx prisma migrate reset

# This will automatically run the seed script
```

## On-Chain Seeding Requirements

To use on-chain seeding, you need:

1. **Backend Wallet**: Set `BACKEND_WALLET_PK` in your `.env` file with a funded wallet private key.

2. **ETH for Gas**: The wallet needs ETH on Base Sepolia for transaction fees. Get free testnet ETH from:
   - https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/base-sepolia
   - https://faucet.quicknode.com/base/sepolia

3. **RPC Connection**: Optionally set `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` for more reliable RPC connections.

### Environment Variables for On-Chain Seeding

```env
# Required for on-chain seeding
BACKEND_WALLET_PK=0x...your-private-key...

# Optional: Enable on-chain seeding by default
SEED_ONCHAIN_CAMPAIGNS=true

# Optional: Better RPC reliability (recommended)
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your-alchemy-key

# Optional: Custom RPC URL
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://your-rpc-endpoint
```

### Gas Cost Estimates

Approximate gas costs for on-chain seeding on Base Sepolia:
- Per campaign creation: ~0.001-0.005 ETH
- Total for 10 campaigns: ~0.01-0.05 ETH

## Test User Credentials

After seeding, these users are available for testing:

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| `okwuosahpaschal@gmail.com` | `84316860p*A` | Activist (Gold) |
| `test@ndafundplatform.com` | `TestUser123!` | Donor |
| `admin@ndafundplatform.com` | `AdminPass123!` | Admin (Official) |
| `creator@ndafundplatform.com` | `Creator123!` | Artist (Verified) |
| `donor@ndafundplatform.com` | `Donor123!` | Donor |

Hybrid users (with email) can also use password: `Password123!`

## Seed Script Architecture

### Main Orchestrator: `seed.ts`

The main seed script coordinates the entire seeding process:

1. **Clear Database**: Removes existing data in correct order to avoid FK violations
2. **Seed Blockchain Config**: Seeds supported chains, contracts, and tokens
3. **Seed Users**: Creates 25 users (5 test + 20 random)
4. **Seed Campaigns**: Creates 10 fundraising campaigns (offline OR on-chain)
5. **Seed Posts**: Creates 50-100 posts with varied content
6. **Seed Reposts**: Creates posts that reference other posts
7. **Seed Interactions**: Creates likes, comments, follows, bookmarks
8. **Validate Data**: Confirms all data was seeded correctly

### Individual Seed Files

## Testing with Seeded Data

### Authentication

**Web3 Login:**
- Use any seeded user's wallet address
- SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum) flow

**Web2 Login (Hybrid Users):**
- Email: Any user with email field populated
- Password: `Password123!` (default for all hybrid users)

### Sample Queries

```graphql
# Get all users
query {
  users {
    id
    username
    displayName
    followersCount
  }
}

# Get all campaigns
query {
  fundraisers {
    id
    name
    goalAmount
    raisedAmount
    isActive
  }
}

# Get feed posts
query {
  posts(take: 20) {
    id
    content
    author {
      username
      displayName
    }
    likesCount
    repostsCount
  }
}
```

## Customization

### Adjusting Data Volume

Edit the seed files to change quantities:

```typescript
// posts.seed.ts
const totalPosts = faker.number.int({ min: 50, max: 100 }); // Change these values

// interactions.seed.ts
const totalLikes = faker.number.int({ min: 500, max: 1000 }); // Change these values
```

### Adding New User Types

```typescript
// users.seed.ts
const userTypes = [
  ...Array(5).fill('activist'),
  ...Array(5).fill('entrepreneur'),
  ...Array(5).fill('artist'),
  ...Array(5).fill('donor'),
  ...Array(5).fill('your-new-type'), // Add new type
];
```

### Custom Campaign Templates

Add new campaigns to the `campaignTemplates` array in `campaigns.seed.ts`.

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to database"

- Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- Check `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`
- Verify database exists

### "Foreign key constraint violation"

- The clear function should handle this automatically
- Try `npx prisma migrate reset` for a full reset

### "Unique constraint violation"

- This should not happen as the script handles uniqueness
- Try clearing the database manually first

### Performance Issues

- Offline seeding takes 30-60 seconds typically
- On-chain seeding takes 2-5 minutes (blockchain confirmations)
- For large datasets, consider batching creates
- Check database connection pool settings

### On-Chain Seeding Issues

#### "No BACKEND_WALLET_PK configured"

Set the private key in your `.env`:
```env
BACKEND_WALLET_PK=0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```

#### "Insufficient ETH for gas"

Fund your wallet with testnet ETH from the faucets listed above.

#### "Failed to connect to RPC"

1. Check your internet connection
2. Set `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` for more reliable connections
3. Try a different RPC endpoint

#### "Transaction reverted"

Check the contract parameters. Common issues:
- Goal amount too low (< minimum configured in contract)
- Duration too short (< 7 days)
- Invalid beneficiary address

## Advanced Usage

### Seed Specific Tables Only

```typescript
// In seed.ts, comment out steps you don't need
await seedUsers(); // Keep
// await seedCampaigns(users); // Skip
// await seedPosts(users, campaigns); // Skip
```

### Custom Seed Data

```typescript
// Create your own seed functions
async function seedCustomData() {
  await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      walletAddress: '0x1234...',
      username: 'custom_user',
      // ... your data
    },
  });
}
```

### Production Considerations

**DO NOT run seed scripts in production!**

The seed script includes:
- `clearDatabase()` which DELETES ALL DATA
- Test data not suitable for production
- Predictable test credentials

Use migrations and manual data entry for production.

## Dependencies

- `@faker-js/faker` - Fake data generation
- `ethers` - Wallet address generation
- `bcrypt` - Password hashing
- `@prisma/client` - Database access

## Contributing

When adding new seed data:

1. Create/update seed file in `prisma/seeds/`
2. Update main orchestrator in `seed.ts`
3. Add validation in `validateSeedData()`
4. Update this README with new data characteristics
5. Test with `npm run seed`
