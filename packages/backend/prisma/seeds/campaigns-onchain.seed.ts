/**
 * On-Chain Campaign Seeding Script
 *
 * This script creates fundraiser campaigns both on-chain (via FundraiserFactory contract)
 * and in the database. Each campaign is first created on the blockchain, then the
 * returned on-chain data (ID, contract address, tx hash) is used to create the database record.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - BACKEND_WALLET_PK environment variable must be set with a funded wallet
 * - The wallet must have enough ETH to pay for gas on Base Sepolia
 * - RPC connection to Base Sepolia must be working
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run seed:campaigns
 *   # or
 *   ts-node prisma/seeds/campaigns-onchain.seed.ts

**The Challenge:**
Over 300 million people in Africa lack access to safe drinking water. In the rural villages we serve, families walk an average of 6 kilometers daily to collect water from contaminated sources.

**Our Solution:**
- Install 15 community solar-powered water wells
- Train local maintenance technicians for sustainability
- Establish water management committees in each village
- Provide water quality testing and monitoring

**Expected Impact:**
- 8,000+ people with clean water access
- 75% reduction in waterborne diseases
- 300+ hours per family reclaimed annually
- Local job creation through maintenance programs

Every contribution brings us closer to ensuring no child walks miles for water that could make them sick.`,

- Original score by Grammy-winning Latin American composers
- Impact campaign and educational resources

**Distribution Strategy:**
- Major film festival premiere (Sundance/Toronto submission)

- Free educational screenings in 1,000+ schools globally
- Community ownership of footage for advocacy

- Q2: Mobile app beta with 500 users
- Q3: Integration with 5 healthcare providers
- Q4: Public launch and API release

**Funding Allocation:**
Security audits (30%), development (40%), pilot programs (20%), regulatory compliance (10%)
