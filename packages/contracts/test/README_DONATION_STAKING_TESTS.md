## Key Testing Patterns Used

### 1. **Fixture Pattern**
All tests use `loadFixture` for consistent, gas-efficient test state:
```javascript
async function deployFixture() {
    // Deploy contracts
    // Mint tokens
    // Setup permissions
    return { contracts, signers };
}

it("test name", async function() {
    const { contract, signer } = await loadFixture(deployFixture);
    // Test logic
});
```

### 2. **Helper Functions**
Reusable functions for common operations:
```javascript
async function createTestFundraiser(factory, creator, beneficiary) {
    const tx = await factory.connect(creator).createFundraiser(...);
    // Extract addresses from events
    return { fundraiser, stakingPool, fundraiserId };
}

async function makeDonation(fundraiser, usdcToken, donor, amount) {
    await usdcToken.mint(address, amount);
    await fundraiser.creditDonation(donor, amount, "test");
}
```

### 3. **Event Verification**
All state-changing operations verify event emission:
```javascript
await expect(factory.connect(donor).donateNative(id, { value: eth("1") }))
    .to.emit(fundraiser, "DonationCredited")
    .withArgs(donor.address, anyValue, "native-local");
```

### 4. **Custom Error Testing**
Using ethers v6 custom error matchers:
```javascript
await expect(factory.donateERC20(0, token, 0))
    .to.be.revertedWithCustomError(factory, "InvalidAmount");
```

### 5. **Time Manipulation**
Using Hardhat Network Helpers for time-dependent tests:
```javascript
await time.increase(60 * 60); // Fast forward 1 hour
await time.increase(24 * 60 * 60); // Fast forward 24 hours
```

### 6. **Gas Benchmarking**
All critical functions have gas benchmarks:
```javascript
const tx = await factory.connect(donor).donateNative(id, { value: eth("1") });
const receipt = await tx.wait();
console.log("Gas used:", receipt.gasUsed.toString());
expect(receipt.gasUsed).to.be.lt(250000); // Target: < 250k gas
```

## Mock Contracts Used

All tests use production-grade mocks from `contracts/test/DeFiMocks.sol`:

- **MockERC20** - Standard ERC20 with mint capability
- **MockWETH** - WETH9 implementation
- **MockUniswapRouter** - Simulates 1inch/Uniswap swaps
- **MockAavePool** - Simulates Aave lending pool (supply/withdraw)

These mocks provide realistic behavior for:
- Token transfers and approvals
- ETH wrapping/unwrapping
- Token swapping (maintains 1:1 ratio for testing)
- Aave yield generation

## Next Steps

1. **Run All Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

2. **Check Coverage**
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   ```
   - Target: 100% line and branch coverage
   - Review uncovered lines in coverage report

3. **Gas Optimization Review**
   ```bash
   npm run test:gas
   ```
   - Review gas consumption for critical functions
   - Optimize functions exceeding targets

4. **Integration with CI/CD**
   - Add tests to GitHub Actions workflow
   - Run on every PR
   - Require 100% pass rate for merge

5. **Additional Test Suites Needed** (from existing codebase):
   - ✅ `FundraiserSystem.test.js` (already exists - integration tests)
   - ✅ `StakingPool.enhanced.test.js` (already exists - yield splits)
   - ✅ `Fundraiser.refund.test.js` (already exists - refund logic)
   - 🔲 `WealthBuildingDonation.test.js` (partially exists - needs enhancement)
   - 🔲 `CrossChain.test.js` (needs LayerZero testnet deployment)
